This project involves the design and development of a SONAR receiver system using EDA tools, specifically Autodesk EAGLE. The design includes both schematic capture and PCB layout tailored for ultrasonic wave detection and processing applications. The receiver circuit is optimized to interface with transducers to capture reflected sound signals, amplifying and conditioning them for further analysis. This compact, real-time hardware solution is ideal for sonar-based distance measurement, object detection, and embedded sensing systems.
